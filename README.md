**DEVELOPING STRATEGIES FOR THE BIDDING CARD GAME ’DIAMONDS’
WITH GENAI**

**Introduction**

Diamonds is a captivating card game blending luck and strategy. The game involves three
players, each assigned a suit except for diamonds, which remain separate initially. A random
diamond card is drawn for bidding, conducted secretly, with the highest bidder obtaining the
card, valued according to its rank in points. Subsequent diamond cards are bid on until all are
acquired, after which players tally points earned from their diamond cards to determine the
winner based on the highest total points amassed
With the rise of artificial intelligence, particularly generative models like ChatGPT and
Gemini, there’s an opportunity to explore strategies to increase the chances of winning this
game. This project aims to discuss the process of teaching GenAI the game, iterating upon
strategies, and writing a python code for the same.

**Problem Statement**

The primary challenge is to teach GenAI the game’s rules comprehensively and ensure
its understanding through interactive gameplay and questioning. Subsequently, the aim is to
develop strategies competitive against human players and possibly uncover new insights into
the game dynamics.
